# üè∞ Asgard - Decentralized Image Storage Platform

**Web3 application delivering true data ownership through blockchain technology**

## Overview

Asgard revolutionizes digital asset storage by combining cutting-edge blockchain technology with decentralized file systems. Built on Polygon's high-performance network and IPFS protocol, it delivers enterprise-grade security with consumer-friendly usability.

**Key Benefits:**
- True Ownership: Cryptographic proof of ownership with no central authority control
- Lightning Performance: 2-second transaction finality with sub-cent costs
- Decentralized Architecture: IPFS distributed storage with zero single points of failure
- Enterprise Security: Smart contract access control with zero-knowledge privacy
- User Friendly: Automatic network switching and intuitive interface

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18.2, Vite 5.0, TailwindCSS 3.4, JavaScript ES2024
- **Blockchain:** Solidity 0.8.19, Ethers.js 6.15, Hardhat 2.22, Polygon Amoy
- **Infrastructure:** IPFS, Pinata Gateway, Vercel Deployment

## Features

- Decentralized Upload: Store images on IPFS with blockchain verification
